Today I will try to make bouncing ball with completely Vex. My aim is creating adjustable bouncing amounts, height and destination point in movement of natural look.
First I have to say that, I very infulienced John Kunz's bouncing balls tutorial and I added and changed some parts of it to reach my goal.
